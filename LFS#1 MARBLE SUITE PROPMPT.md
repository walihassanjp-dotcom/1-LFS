Coordinates: 25.030067, 67.030386
I want to extract radiance values from a 3000 meter buffer zone around the coordiantes. Please analyse the dataset, and give the following:
1- Make an excel sheet 
2- Calculate mean radiance, median radiance, min radiance, max radiance, pixel count, units of radiance, timestamps of readings extracted
3-  I want the values for each month (jan-dec) from 2014 to 2024
4- plot the monthly mean radiance results and median radiance results on a chart against each month of the year

note: The radiance values should be representative of the 3 km buffer area around the coordinates (landfill site). Please dont extract values outside the 3000 m buffer zone.

Please ask me follow-up questions if you want clarity. For my research I want to plot mean and median radiance values on the chart, that monthly mean radiance and median radiance values from 2014-2025 with a regression trend line.
